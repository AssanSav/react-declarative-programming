# React Declarative Programming

## Objectives

1. Explain the difference between declarative and imperative programming
2. Describe the benefits of declarative programming with respect to React
3. Describe some of the trade-offs of declarative programming

## Overview

Simply put, we want to take students to a higher level of abstraction so that
they can start acquiring tools to think about how they're putting their
applications together â€” and how we all might do so better.

It's not so much that imperative programming is "bad," but rather that it can
make it harder to spot useful abstractions, and it can make our applications
complex in unanticipated ways. Declarative programming can do so, too, but it
can help reframe our approach to problems by highlighting the problems
themselves.
